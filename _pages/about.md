My name is Steven Seeley, but I am also known as mr_me. I'm an information security specialist and I'm originally from Australia. After having worked in the United States for a few years, I now reside in Latin America. I have years of local and international experience in corporate and government penetration tests, source code audits and security research.

This site is intended to be a central location for much of my research (but not all). If you are curious, this site is build with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">github pages</a>.

You can read my technical <a href="/blog">blog</a> or find out more about me on my <a href="https://about.me/steven.seeley" target="_blank">about.me</a> page.
