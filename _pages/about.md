My name is Steven Seeley, but I am also known as `mr_me`. I'm an information security specialist and I'm back in Australia after having worked in north and central America for a decade. I have years of local and international experience in corporate and government penetration tests, source code audits and security research. I also teach a technical hacking class called [Full Stack Web Attack](/training) where students learn to dive into source code and hunt language specific edge cases to detect high impact vulnerabilities and exploit them.

These days I spend less time on a computer and more time with loved ones and practicing hermeticism. This site is intended to be a central location for much of my research (but not all). If you are curious, this site is build with <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">jekyll</a> and hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">github pages</a>. You can read my technical <a href="/blog">blog</a> or get in [contact](/contact) with me if you have any questions.
