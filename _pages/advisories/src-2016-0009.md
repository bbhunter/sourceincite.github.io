body: |
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ATutor. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability however authentication bypass vulnerabilities are known and remote registration is open by default.
 <br /><br />
 The specific flaw exists in the ‘password_reminder.php’ script when performing a password reset. The code attempts to perform a sanity check on the current session array after a new session has already been created. This can allow an attacker to bypass the check and reset a members password. An attacker can combine this with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
