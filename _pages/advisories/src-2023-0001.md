body: |
 
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of PTC Thingworx Edge C-SDK. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists within the twHeader_fromStream function. An integer wrap occurs from attacker controlled data which results in an underallocated buffer and subsequent heap overflow in twStream_GetBytes. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service or execute code in the context of the application.
