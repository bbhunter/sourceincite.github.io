body: |
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ATutor. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability however authentication bypass vulnerabilities are known and remote registration is open by default.
 <br /><br />
 The specific flaw exists in the ‘import_test.php’ script. An attacker can upload and extract a zip file containing a directory traversal attack. Files can be extracted into the applications web root by bypassing a poor blacklist sanity check from the preImportCallBack() function. An attacker can leverage this to upload and execute arbitrary php code.
