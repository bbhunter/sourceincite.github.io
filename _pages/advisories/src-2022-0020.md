body: |
 This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of VMware vRealize Operations Manager. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
 
 The specific flaw exists within generateSupportBundle.py script. The issue results from allowing attackers to specify the VCOPS_BASE environment variable which is later used to construct a path. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
