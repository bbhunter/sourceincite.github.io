body: |
 A total of 704 reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities were found that can allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or html via unspecified parameters against vulnerable installations of ATutor. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that a target administrator must visit a malicious page.
 <br /><br />
 The specific flaws exist when directly displaying super global array variables. An attacker can craft a JavaScript payload and deceive an administrator into performing a malicious upload. This can result in remote code execution in the context of the web server.
