body: |
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of ATutor. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability however authentication bypass vulnerabilities are known and remote registration is open by default.
 <br /><br />
 The specific flaw exists in the ‘zip.php’ script. An attacker can upload a zip file using the ‘upload.php’ script containing a directory traversal attack and have them extracted by the ‘zip.php’ script. Files can be extracted into the applications web root by bypassing a poor blacklist sanity check from the preExportCallBack() function. An attacker can leverage this to upload and execute arbitrary php code.
