body: |
 This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Samsung Security Manager. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
 <br /><br />
 The specific flaw exists within the Redis service that is installed as part of this product. By issuing an HTTP POST request, an attacker can create an arbitrary file on the server with attacker controlled data. An attacker can further leverage this vulnerability to execute code on the server as SYSTEM.
